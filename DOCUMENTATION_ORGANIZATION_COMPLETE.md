## README References

### Verified Existing References

The main README.md already contains correct paths to the new documentation structure:

- ✅ `[DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/deployment/DEPLOYMENT.md)` - Production deployment guide
- ✅ `[Authentication & Users](docs/features/auth-users.md)` - User management and security
- ✅ `[Alert System](docs/features/alerts.md)` - Alert rules and event tracking
- ✅ `[Notifications](docs/features/notifications.md)` - Webhook and Telegram setup
- ✅ `[docs/development/](docs/development/)` - Implementation reports reference

**No updates needed** - README already uses the correct documentation structure!
