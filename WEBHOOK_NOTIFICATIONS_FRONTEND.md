# Webhook Notifications UI - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Agent:** Agent B (Frontend)  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (pending backend test endpoint)

---

## Overview

Implemented a complete webhook management interface in the Settings page, allowing users to configure, manage, and test webhook endpoints for receiving alert notifications.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. React Hook (`lib/alerts/useWebhooks.ts`)

Custom hook providing full CRUD operations for webhooks with proper state management.

**Features:**

- List, create, update, delete webhook operations
- Test webhook functionality (requires backend endpoint)
- Loading and error state management  
- Automatic session expiry handling
- TypeScript types matching backend API

### 2. UI Components (`components/settings/notifications/`)

**WebhookList** - Display component

- Shows all user's webhooks with status indicators
- Color-coded status pills (green/amber/red)
- Displays failure tracking and last activity timestamps
- Action buttons: Test, Edit, Delete

**WebhookForm** - Create/Edit modal

- HTTPS URL validation
- Secret field with 16-128 character requirement
- Active/inactive toggle
- Edit mode: optional secret rotation
- Inline validation errors

**WebhookEmptyState** - Onboarding

- Friendly first-time user experience
- Educational content about webhook security
- Clear call-to-action

**DeleteWebhookDialog** - Confirmation

- Reuses existing AlertDialog component
- Shows webhook URL in confirmation message
- Loading state during deletion

### 3. Settings Page Integration

- New "Notifications" section alongside password settings
- Conditional rendering based on webhook count
- Toast notifications for all operations
- Comprehensive error handling

## Technical Details

### API Integration

| Endpoint | Method | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| List webhooks | GET `/notifications/webhooks` | ‚úÖ Working |
| Create webhook | POST `/notifications/webhooks` | ‚úÖ Working |
| Update webhook | PUT `/notifications/webhooks/{id}` | ‚úÖ Working |
| Delete webhook | DELETE `/notifications/webhooks/{id}` | ‚úÖ Working |
| Test webhook | POST `/notifications/webhooks/{id}/test` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending backend |

### Validation Rules

- **URL:** Must use HTTPS protocol
- **Secret:** 16-128 characters required
- **Active:** Boolean toggle for enabling/disabling
- **User ownership:** Verified server-side

### Design System

- Glassmorphism aesthetic matching LunaSentri theme
- Status pills with semantic colors:
  - Emerald: Active, no failures
  - Amber: Active, 1-2 failures  
  - Red: Active, 3+ failures
  - Gray: Inactive
- Responsive layout with proper spacing
- Accessibility considerations (labels, ARIA attributes)

---

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`__tests__/useWebhooks.test.ts`)

- ‚úÖ Webhook fetching on mount
- ‚úÖ Error state handling
- ‚úÖ Session expiry event dispatch

### Build Verification

```bash
pnpm build
# ‚úÖ Compiled successfully in 9.4s
# ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
# ‚úÖ All pages rendered correctly
```

### Test Suite

```bash
pnpm test
# ‚úÖ All 19 tests passing
# ‚úÖ New: 3 useWebhooks tests
# ‚úÖ Existing tests: severity, useMetrics, useSession
```

## Files Modified

1. `apps/web-next/app/settings/page.tsx` - Added Notifications section
2. `project/context/alerts-notifications.md` - Marked frontend task complete
3. `project/logs/agent-b.md` - Updated agent log

---

## User Flows

### First-Time Setup

1. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Notifications
2. See empty state with helpful information
3. Click "Add Your First Webhook"
4. Enter HTTPS URL and secret key
5. Toggle active status
6. Submit to create webhook

### Managing Webhooks

1. View list of configured webhooks
2. See status, last activity, failure tracking
3. Edit webhook to update URL/secret/status
4. Delete webhook with confirmation
5. Test webhook to verify configuration

### Error Handling

1. Form validation prevents invalid inputs
2. Network errors show user-friendly messages
3. Session expiry redirects to login
4. Server errors display with retry option

---

## Known Limitations

### Backend Task Required

The test webhook endpoint is not yet implemented. When a user clicks "Test", they will receive an error toast.

**Recommended Backend Implementation:**

```go
// In apps/api-go/internal/notifications/http.go
func (s *WebhookService) HandleTestWebhook(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Extract webhook ID from URL parameters
    // Verify webhook exists and belongs to current user
    // Create mock alert event payload
    // Send to webhook URL using existing delivery logic
    // Return success (200) or error (4xx/5xx) response
}
```

Then add route to main.go:

```go
webhookRouter.HandleFunc("/{id}/test", webhookService.HandleTestWebhook).Methods("POST")
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (High Value)

1. **Webhook Activity Log** - Show delivery history with timestamps and status codes
2. **Payload Preview** - Display the JSON payload that will be sent
3. **Webhook Templates** - Pre-configured setups for popular services (Slack, Discord, PagerDuty)

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)

1. **Retry Configuration** - Allow users to customize retry attempts and delays
2. **Custom Headers** - Support additional HTTP headers for authentication
3. **Batch Testing** - Test all webhooks simultaneously
4. **Webhook Analytics** - Success/failure rates, average response times

### Priority 3 (Future)

1. **Conditional Webhooks** - Only trigger for specific alert rules or severities
2. **Webhook Chaining** - Sequential webhook calls with dependencies
3. **Transformation Rules** - Customize payload format per webhook
4. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent webhook spam with configurable limits
