# Alert Notifications Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds real-time toast notifications for new alert events that appear while users are on the LunaSentri dashboard, providing instant feedback without requiring users to navigate to the Alerts page.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Toast Infrastructure ✅

- **Created shadcn toast components manually** (since CLI wasn't working with Tailwind v4):
  - `components/ui/toast.tsx` - Toast UI components
  - `components/ui/use-toast.ts` - Toast state management hook  
  - `components/ui/toaster.tsx` - Toast provider component
- **Installed required dependencies**: `@radix-ui/react-toast`, `class-variance-authority`, `lucide-react`
- **Added Toaster to app layout**: Mounted `<Toaster />` in `app/layout.tsx`

### 2. Enhanced Alerts Hook ✅

**Created `lib/useAlertsWithNotifications.ts`** that extends the base `useAlerts` hook with:

- **Toast notifications** for previously unseen alert events
- **localStorage tracking** of last seen event ID
- **New alerts count** calculation
- **markAllAsSeen()** function to mark current alerts as seen
- **Smart severity detection** based on metric type and threshold distance

### 3. User Interface Updates ✅

**Updated main dashboard (`app/page.tsx`)**:

- Uses `useAlertsWithNotifications` instead of basic `useAlerts`
- Shows "new" badge when there are unseen alerts
- Displays both unacknowledged count and new alerts count

**Updated alerts page (`app/alerts/page.tsx`)**:

- Uses the enhanced notifications hook
- Added "Mark all as seen" button in the Active Alerts card header
- Shows new alerts count badge alongside unacknowledged count

## Technical Implementation Details

### Alert Notification Logic

1. **First Load**: Sets last seen event ID to the most recent event (prevents spam on first visit)
2. **New Events Detection**: Compares event IDs against stored last seen ID
3. **Toast Display**: Shows notifications with:
   - Severity-based styling (Critical/Warning/Info)
   - Rule name and metric information  
   - Current value vs threshold
   - 8-second display duration

### Severity Calculation

The system determines alert severity based on how far the current value is from the threshold:

**CPU/Memory alerts:**

- Critical: ≥20% difference from threshold
- Warning: ≥10% difference from threshold
- Default: <10% difference

**Disk alerts:**

- Critical: ≥10% difference from threshold
- Warning: ≥5% difference from threshold
- Default: <5% difference

### Toast Variants

- `destructive` (red) - Critical alerts
- `warning` (yellow) - Warning level alerts  
- `default` (blue) - Info/normal alerts

## Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Import the enhanced hook**:

```typescript
import { useAlertsWithNotifications } from '@/lib/useAlertsWithNotifications';
```

2. **Use in components**:

```typescript
const { 
  events, 
  newAlertsCount, 
  markAllAsSeen,
  // ... all other useAlerts properties
} = useAlertsWithNotifications(limit);
```

3. **Handle new alerts**:

```typescript
// Show new alerts count
{newAlertsCount > 0 && (
  <Badge>{newAlertsCount} new</Badge>
)}

// Allow users to mark as seen
<button onClick={markAllAsSeen}>
  Mark all as seen
</button>
```

### For Users

1. **Automatic notifications**: Toast notifications appear automatically when new alerts are triggered
2. **Mark as seen**: Click "Mark all as seen" on the Alerts page to clear the "new" indicator
3. **Persistent tracking**: The system remembers which alerts you've seen across browser sessions

## Files Modified/Created

### Created

- `components/ui/toast.tsx` - Toast UI components
- `components/ui/use-toast.ts` - Toast state management  
- `components/ui/toaster.tsx` - Toast provider
- `lib/useAlertsWithNotifications.ts` - Enhanced alerts hook

### Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Added Toaster provider
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated to use notifications hook
- `app/alerts/page.tsx` - Added new alerts UI and mark as seen functionality
- `package.json` - Added toast dependencies

## Browser Compatibility

- Uses localStorage for persistence (supported in all modern browsers)
- Graceful degradation if localStorage unavailable
- Toast animations use CSS transforms (IE10+)

## Performance Considerations

- Notifications only trigger on actual new events (not on page refresh)
- LocalStorage updates are minimal (only when new events appear)
- Toast limit set to 1 to prevent notification spam
- Automatic cleanup after 5 seconds

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Sound notifications** for critical alerts
2. **Browser push notifications** when tab is not active
3. **Email/SMS integration** for critical alerts
4. **Customizable notification preferences** per user
5. **Alert grouping** for multiple similar alerts
6. **Snooze functionality** for temporarily hiding alerts

This implementation provides a solid foundation for real-time alert monitoring while maintaining good user experience and performance.
